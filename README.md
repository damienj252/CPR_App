This is a windows 10 app that will teach the user how to preform hands only CPR as well as an exact GPS location of longitude and latitude

# Why I built this application
Many people die each year from heart related issues and many people have heart attacks on a day to day basis and many of those causes
leades to death but many of these deaths could have been prevented if someone knew this simple life saving skill. I hope this app spreads
this life saving skill it will also give the user their exact location using the GPS on their device. It is simple and easy to learn.
